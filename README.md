## üöÄ Overview

The **MariaDB AI Optimizer** is a cutting-edge, AI-powered toolkit designed to supercharge your MariaDB database management. Inspired by advanced cloud database optimization strategies (adapted from AWS Redshift best practices), this suite deploys specialized **sub-agents** to analyze, optimize, and validate your MariaDB schemas and queries. Built with FastAPI, it provides a RESTful API for seamless integration into your workflows, delivering actionable insights to boost performance, reduce costs, and ensure data integrity.

### Why MariaDB AI Optimizer?
- **Performance Boost**: Automatically rewrite slow queries, suggest indexes, and optimize execution plans using MariaDB's EXPLAIN and PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.
- **Schema Intelligence**: Normalize or denormalize tables intelligently to balance query speed and storage efficiency.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Identify resource-heavy patterns and recommend caching, compression, and archiving strategies.
- **Data Reliability**: Validate ETL loads and data integrity with automated comparisons and anomaly detection.
- **API-First Design**: RESTful endpoints with interactive Swagger documentation for easy integration and testing.
- **Production-Ready**: Dockerized backend, Render deployment support, and comprehensive error handling.

This tool is perfect for teams managing high-traffic applications on MariaDB, helping you scale efficiently without deep SQL expertise.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### Sub-Agents
1. **Query Optimizer** (`query_optimizer`)
   - Analyzes SQL queries for bottlenecks like full table scans or inefficient joins.
   - Suggests rewrites, index recommendations (e.g., BTREE for equality searches), and query caching.
   - Leverages MariaDB's EXPLAIN to simulate and improve execution plans.

2. **Schema Normalizer** (`schema_normalizer`)
   - Reviews table structures for over-normalization issues impacting join performance.
   - Recommends denormalization, foreign key constraints, and column encoding (e.g., InnoDB compression).
   - Suggests optimal partitioning for large tables.

3. **Cost Saver** (`cost_saver`)
   - Scans query history for expensive operations (high CPU/IO).
   - Proposes materialized views, temporary tables, and data unloading to reduce storage costs.
   - Integrates with PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA for real-time stats.

4. **Data Validation Agent** (`data_validation`)
   - Compares row counts, aggregates, and checksums between MariaDB tables and sources (e.g., CSV, external DBs).
   - Detects duplicates, null anomalies, and referential integrity issues.
   - Supports ETL validation workflows.

### Technical Highlights
- **API**: FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy for MariaDB connectivity (PyMySQL driver). Pydantic for input validation.
- **Utils**: Dedicated modules for EXPLAIN analysis, schema introspection (SHOW/DESCRIBE), and cost statistics.
- **Deployment**: Docker for local/dev, Render.yaml for cloud (free tier friendly).
- **Security**: Env-based DB credentials, input sanitization to prevent SQL injection.
- **Extensibility**: Modular agent design allows easy addition of new optimizers.

Data flow: Client sends requests to API ‚Üí Agents query MariaDB ‚Üí Return JSON insights with suggestions and analysis.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- **MariaDB**: Version 10.6+ (tested with 11.x). A running instance with sample data for testing.
- **Python**: 3.11+
- **Docker**: For containerized backend (optional)
- **Git**: For cloning the repo

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd repo
```

### 2. Backend Setup (API)
```bash
cd api
# Using Poetry (recommended)
poetry install
# Or pip
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Generate via pyproject.toml

# Copy env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MariaDB creds:
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=3306
# DB_USER=root
# DB_PASS=yourpassword
# DB_NAME=mariadb_sample

# Run migrations (if needed) or just start
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API docs (Swagger).

### 3. Docker (API Only)
```bash
cd api
docker build -t mariadb-ai-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env mariadb-ai-api
```

### 4. Frontend Setup (Web)
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:5173
```
The web app connects to the API at `http://localhost:8000` (update `src/lib/api.ts` for prod).

### 5. Deployment to Render
- Push to GitHub.
- Connect Render.com, use `render.yaml` for auto-deploy (includes both API and web services).
- Set env vars in Render dashboard.

## üíª Usage Examples

### Query Optimization
Send a POST request to `/optimize-query` with the query:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM users JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id WHERE city = 'NYC';"
}
```
Response includes suggestions like:
- "Add index on users(city) to avoid full scan."
- Rewritten query with LIMIT or subquery optimization.
- EXPLAIN plan analysis.

### Schema Normalization
Send a POST request to `/normalize-schema` with table names:
```json
{
  "table_names": ["users", "orders"]
}
```
Response: Recommendations like "Denormalize city into users table for faster joins."

### Cost Saving
Send a POST request to `/save-costs` with queries:
```json
{
  "queries": ["SELECT * FROM users;", "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;"]
}
```
Response: "This JOIN scans 1M rows ‚Äì use partitioning on date column."

### Data Validation
Send a POST request to `/validate-data` with table details:
```json
{
  "table_name": "users",
  "expected_count": 1000
}
```
Response: "Row count mismatch: 1000 vs 999. Check for duplicates."
